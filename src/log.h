/*
 * LogStream
 *
 * The public interface for log streams (infostream, verbosestream, etc).
 *
 * LogStream minimizes the work done when a given stream is off. (meaning
 * it has no output targets, so it goes to /dev/null)
 *
 * For example, consider:
 *
 *     verbosestream << "hello world" << 123 << '\n';
 *
 * The compiler evaluates this as:
 *
 *   (((verbosestream << "hello world") << 123) << '\n')
 *      ^                            ^
 *
 * If `verbosestream` is on, the innermost expression (marked by ^) will return
 * a StreamProxy that forwards to a real ostream, that feeds into the logger.
 * However, if `verbosestream` is off, it will return a StreamProxy that does
 * nothing on all later operations. Specifically, CPU time won't be wasted
 * writing "hello world" and 123 into a buffer, or formatting the log entry.
 *
 * It is also possible to directly check if the stream is on/off:
 *
 *   if (verbosestream) {
 *       auto data = ComputeExpensiveDataForTheLog();
 *       verbosestream << data << endl;
 *   }
 *
