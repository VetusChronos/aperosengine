# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest stable version for security issues.
See the [releases page](https://github.com/VetusChronos/aperosengine/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We ask that you report vulnerabilities privately, by contacting a core developer,
to give us time to fix them. You can do that by emailing one of the following addresses:

* vetuschronos@hotmail.com

Depending on severity, we will either create a private issue for the vulnerability
and release a patch version of Aperos Engine, or give you permission to file the issue publicly.

For more information on the justification of this policy, see
[Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).
