Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\AperosEngine\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\AperosEngine (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\AperosEngine` or `%APEROSENGINE_USER_PATH%`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/aperosengine`
    * `user`  = `~/.aperosengine` or `$APEROSENGINE_USER_PATH`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User` or `~/Library/Application Support/aperosengine` or `$APEROSENGINE_USER_PATH`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/aperosengine.conf`
- This file is created by closing AperosEngine for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../aperosengine.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../aperosengine.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.
- Stage is incremented when the indicate whether the engine has been released, 
is in beta, alpha, or in dev

**Stages**:

- **Release**: Indicates that the engine has been released
- **Beta**: Indicates that the engie is in beta phase, and that new feature additions are paused and current features will be polished
- **Alpha**: Indicates that the engine is in the alpha phase, and that new feature additions are being implemented, removed or being tested, which may result in instability
- **Dev**: Indicates that the engine has not been released for official testing
